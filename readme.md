# Coiffeur Project
I started this project to study how to use Laravel, and improve my HTML, CSS and PHP skills.

## The project
The basic idea was to have a place where I could track clients, services and jobs done, so I Build a CRUD for each of the models, later on I needed a place to quick view incomes from past week/month, since I don't have all the knowledge I want, I tried to keep it simple, but functional.

## To-do
Since I'm still learning, there is things I don't know, or don't know how to implement. I know this project has a lot of flaws, but I'm just a beginner. =)

+ Learn how to test! (Priority number one!)
+ Clean unused code (I changed my mind about a couple of things and some codes are left unused)
+ Refactory (I need to learn design patter, maybe after that I should rewrite most of the codes)
+ Use Form Request
+ Use more Query Scopes (The ones I created are pretty sloppy)
+ Use Mailables / Queues (Auth controller need emails to reset password)
+ Rewrite the Reports (I don't know if the way I implemented it was the best way)
